[Cram](https://www.usecram.com) is the simple and intuitive memory tool I wish I had before. It is a responsive web application designed for mobile, tablet, and desktop users alike. Cram is written in **JavaScript using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end**. 

Curious about Cram? Have a look at [Cram's website](https://www.usecram.com) for more information and demos. If you want to build off of Cram feel free to fork the repository.

## Technologies Used
The main three tools I used to make this application are React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I used Figma for design.
